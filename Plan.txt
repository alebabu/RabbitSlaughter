--SHORT DESCRIPTION--

The game is about killing as many rabbits as possible and earn points. This game will be in 2d. Your weapons will be an axe
to kill the rabbits, you will also be able to earn new weapons by killing the rabbits, like a flamethrower. This game will
be simply to make so we will have some nice adds like highscore. The idea is to have an online database with the highscore
on so you can beat other players scores. Most of all we will focus on the animations, sounds and meny's for an example
you can earn some activements.
